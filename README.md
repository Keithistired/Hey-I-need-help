# Hey-I-need-help
My identity is compromised , I'm living in a homeless shelter and my phone keeps getting hacked can anyone help , I don't have a lot of money man but I'll pay if anyone can help, I have no idea how this works , I'm kinda proud I figured out how to poat this


I can't afford to get bogged down with third party software I can't figure it out , I bow to you guys honestly I can do some intelligent things but not this cheers to you guys.  I just don't have anyone ya know, my phone is my sanctuary it's really all I have left... I don't even know why I'm typing any of this out, I should just end it
